#####            Function for One Simulation Run              #####
###################################################################

# one simulation run: takes the input data, handles it according
# to the parameters in the simulation design matrix,
# calculates the ICCs and calculates outcome statistics on them
# (i.e., mean, SD, ...)
# i.e., one simulation = one row in the simulation matrix
# absolute outcome measures can be calculated within each simulation run
# relative outcome measures need the benchmark data
# -> take benchmark data as argument
# --> split into two parts for clarity


# function takes as input all parameters that we want to vary:
# number of occasions, occasions drawn (random vs. ordered) and
# number of items (and therefore also item content)
# function also takes as input all arguments that we need for
# functions used:
# data, id.var, occ.running.var, nr.of.occasions
# type (for ICC), unit (for ICC)
# function also takes as input the benchmark data (ICCs calculated for benchmark)
# that the relative outcome measures are calculated in comparison to: benchmark_ICCdata

# items (for ICC) -> determined within function according to nr.of.items
# type (for ICC): default here is consistency, but could be varied in principle in simulation
# unit (for ICC): default here is single measurements, but could be varied in principle in simulation
